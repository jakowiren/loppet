# Phase 1 Completion Roadmap

## üéØ Current Status
- **Backend**: 90% complete (all APIs implemented)
- **Frontend Infrastructure**: 90% complete (auth context, API client, routing)
- **Frontend UI**: 40% complete (missing forms and auth UI)
- **External Setup**: 0% complete (needs Supabase + Google OAuth)

## üìã Complete Order of Execution

### üö® CRITICAL: External Setup Must Be Done First
**Before any development work can continue, complete ALL steps in `PHASE1_EXTERNAL_TASKS.md`**

**Estimated Time: 50 minutes**
1. Supabase Database Setup (5 min)
2. Google OAuth Setup (10 min) 
3. Local Environment Configuration (3 min)
4. Database Migration (2 min)
5. Supabase Backend Deployment (15 min)
6. Vercel Environment Configuration (5 min)
7. Testing & Verification (10 min)

**‚ùó Stop here if external setup fails - nothing else will work without this foundation.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Dependencies

**Cannot proceed with development until external setup is complete:**
- Database connection must work
- Google OAuth must be configured
- Environment variables must be set
- Backend must be deployed and accessible

**Each step depends on the previous:**
- Auth UI needs working backend auth
- Project creation needs auth to work
- Admin panel needs projects being created
- Dashboard needs user data

**Testing requirements:**
- Each feature must be tested locally before moving to next
- Production deployment must be verified after each major feature
- End-to-end testing only possible when all pieces work together
